whatever i give after T1, is it centered automatically? By default, whatever you specify after `TITLE 1` (T1) in an Easytrieve report is automatically centered within the available line width, as determined by the `LINESIZE` parameter of the `REPORT` statement[1][2][5]. This centering applies to all title lines unless you explicitly override it using the `NOADJUST` parameter, which causes the title to be left-justified instead[2]. 

So, unless you specify otherwise, your T1 content will appear centered at the top of each report page.


Here’s a professionally worded and polite draft email you can send to the person to express your concerns and stress the importance of the meeting:

Subject: Follow-up on Rescheduled Meeting

Hi [Name],

I hope you're doing well.

We had rescheduled our meeting based on your proposed time, but unfortunately, it did not happen as expected. I understand that things can get busy, but I wanted to highlight that this discussion is critical for us to move forward with our work.

The task at hand is time-sensitive and aligns with current industry developments. Any delay in its completion could impact our ability to stay aligned with ongoing changes and expectations.

Could you please let me know a time that works best for you in the next day or two? It’s important we close on the pending points at the earliest.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Let me know if you'd like to make it more assertive or more conciliatory, depending on your relationship with the person.
