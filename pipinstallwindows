You can install Python packages to an alternate path (where you have write access) using pipâ€™s --target option. Here's how:

1. Install to a custom directory

pip install <package-name> --target "C:\Path\To\My\Packages"

For example:

pip install requests --target "C:\Users\Harsh\python_packages"

This installs the requests package and its dependencies into that directory.

2. Use the packages in your scripts

You must add that directory to sys.path before importing the package:

import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "C:\\Users\\Harsh\\python_packages")

import requests


---

3. Use it from the command line or scripts globally

If you want Python to always look in your custom path:

Set the PYTHONPATH environment variable:


PowerShell:

$env:PYTHONPATH = "C:\Users\Harsh\python_packages"
python myscript.py

Command Prompt:

set PYTHONPATH=C:\Users\Harsh\python_packages
python myscript.py

Would you like a script or a batch file to automate this setup?
