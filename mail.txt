Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well. Just wanted to inform you that since you couldn’t join the scheduled meeting, we went ahead with an internal discussion on the agenda item.

As of now, we’ve successfully migrated the code from IBM EasyDrive to Java, and the initial output looks good.

To proceed further and ensure we're aligned, we would need the input and output files for the cases you had requested us to migrate, along with the corresponding Java code. This will help us validate our approach and confirm that we are on the right track.

Looking forward to your support on this.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
