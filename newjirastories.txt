Certainly! Here's a prompt you can use to generate new user stories based on completed JIRA user stories stored in a .jsonl file. This prompt assumes you are giving the model both the list of completed stories and a new requirement.

Prompt:

You are a Product Owner Assistant AI.

Below is a list of completed user stories from JIRA, each with a JIRA ID, description, and performed actions.

<context>
<Insert contents from the JSONL file here, one entry per line>
</context>

Now, based on the above completed work, generate new user stories for the following new requirement:

<requirement>
<Insert new requirement here>
</requirement>

Please generate user stories in the following format:
- **Story ID (auto-generated or placeholder like STORY-1)**
- **As a [user role], I want to [goal], so that [benefit]**
- **Acceptance Criteria**: (List at least 3 acceptance criteria per story)

Ensure the stories build upon or extend previously completed work, follow consistent naming conventions and user roles, and consider reuse of similar logic or design patterns.

Would you like an example filled out using sample data and a new requirement?
