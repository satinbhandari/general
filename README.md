9If you want to override both the default headers and model in your derived class while extending ChatOpenAI, you can modify the headers and model attributes inside the subclass constructor.


---

‚úÖ Solution:

from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

class CustomChatOpenAI(ChatOpenAI):
    def __init__(self, model_name="gpt-4-turbo", **kwargs):
        super().__init__(model_name=model_name, **kwargs)  # Pass updated model to parent
        self.headers = {  # Override default headers
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.api_key}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "Custom-Header": "MyValue"  # Example custom header
        }

# Usage
chat = CustomChatOpenAI(api_key="your_api_key")
print(chat.model_name)  # Output: gpt-4-turbo
print(chat.headers)     # Output: Custom headers dictionary


---

üîπ How It Works

1. Extends ChatOpenAI ‚Üí Inherits all functionality.


2. Overrides Default Model ‚Üí The model_name is set to "gpt-4-turbo" by default but can be overridden.


3. Modifies Headers ‚Üí Overrides self.headers with custom values.


4. Passes Arguments Properly ‚Üí Uses super().__init__(model_name=model_name, **kwargs) to initialize ChatOpenAI correctly.

üîç Key Benefits

‚úîÔ∏è Default model (gpt-4-turbo) is predefined but can be changed.
‚úîÔ∏è Default headers are customized with additional values.
‚úîÔ∏è The class remains flexible and supports extra arguments via **kwargs.

Would you like to further customize behavior (e.g., dynamic model selection, extra logging)?






To check if a word exists in another string as an exact match (without being part of another word), you can use regular expressions (re module) in Python.


---

Solution: Use re.search() with Word Boundaries (\b)

The \b ensures that SATIN is treated as a whole word, not part of another word like NOSATIN or SATINIZED.

import re

def contains_exact_word(text, word):
    pattern = rf"\b{re.escape(word)}\b"  # \b ensures exact word match
    return bool(re.search(pattern, text))

# Examples
print(contains_exact_word("This is a SATIN fabric.", "SATIN"))    # ‚úÖ True
print(contains_exact_word("This is NOSATIN fabric.", "SATIN"))    # ‚ùå False
print(contains_exact_word("This is SATINIZED fabric.", "SATIN"))  # ‚ùå False
print(contains_exact_word("SATIN is great.", "SATIN"))            # ‚úÖ True


---

Explanation:

\b ‚Üí Word boundary (ensures SATIN is a separate word).

re.escape(word) ‚Üí Escapes special characters if any.

re.search() ‚Üí Checks if the pattern exists in the text.


‚úÖ This method ensures that only exact whole-word matches are found.

It looks like you're trying to filter and categorize the data into four different scenarios based on the FeatureHasLabel and StoryHasLabel flags. Here's a structured breakdown of how you can achieve this in Python using pandas:

Steps:

1. Read the CSV file.


2. Group stories by FeatureId.


3. Filter data into four categories:

Tab 1: Features where FeatureHasLabel == True, but all corresponding stories have StoryHasLabel == False.

Tab 2: Stories where FeatureHasLabel == False, but at least one corresponding story has StoryHasLabel == True.

Tab 3: Features and stories where both FeatureHasLabel and StoryHasLabel are either True or False.

Tab 4: (Possibly another combination‚Äîplease specify.)



4. Save the results into an Excel file with multiple tabs.




---

Python Code:

import pandas as pd

# Load CSV
df = pd.read_csv("your_file.csv")

# Group by FeatureId to check corresponding stories
grouped = df.groupby("FeatureId")

# Scenario 1: FeatureHasLabel == True, but all corresponding stories have StoryHasLabel == False
tab1 = df[
    (df["FeatureHasLabel"] == True) & 
    (~df["FeatureId"].isin(grouped.filter(lambda x: x["StoryHasLabel"].any())["FeatureId"]))
]

# Scenario 2: FeatureHasLabel == False, but at least one story has StoryHasLabel == True
tab2 = df[
    (df["FeatureHasLabel"] == False) & 
    (df["FeatureId"].isin(grouped.filter(lambda x: x["StoryHasLabel"].any())["FeatureId"]))
]

# Scenario 3: Both FeatureHasLabel and StoryHasLabel are either True or False
tab3 = df[
    ((df["FeatureHasLabel"] == True) & (df["StoryHasLabel"] == True)) |
    ((df["FeatureHasLabel"] == False) & (df["StoryHasLabel"] == False))
]

# Scenario 4: Define what you want here
tab4 = df  # Modify as needed

# Save to Excel with multiple tabs
with pd.ExcelWriter("filtered_data.xlsx") as writer:
    tab1.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="Tab1_FeatureTrue_StoryFalse", index=False)
    tab2.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="Tab2_FeatureFalse_StoryTrue", index=False)
    tab3.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="Tab3_BothTrueOrBothFalse", index=False)
    tab4.to_excel(writer, sheet_name="Tab4_Custom", index=False)


---

Expected Output:

Tab 1: Features with FeatureHasLabel == True, but none of its stories have StoryHasLabel == True.

Tab 2: Stories where FeatureHasLabel == False, but at least one story has StoryHasLabel == True.

Tab 3: Rows where both FeatureHasLabel and StoryHasLabel are either True or False.

Tab 4: (Currently all data, you can modify this condition as needed.)



---

Questions:

1. What should Tab 4 contain? Would you like to filter a specific scenario?


2. Should the final Excel file include all columns from the CSV or only relevant ones?



Let me know if you need any modifications!
